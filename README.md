# Paws and Swords
This is a small virtual card game. It is being developed as a hobby project, 
and is written in typescript with styling using sass. 
It will very soon involve peer-to-peer multiplayer.

## Installation
First ensure node is installed on the system.
To install a client, clone the repo, then run:
```
npm install -g typescript #To ensure that typescript is installed
npm install typings --global #To ensure typings is intsalled
npm install #Install local packages

The `./build.sh` contains the set of commands to compile all src files.
